# Smart Ring
2023 - Present

As you can probably tell, I'm very passionate about smart devices, particularly wearable technology. I was scrolling on Instructables one day and came across a design for a Smart Ring using a very small microcontroller and some buttons. Sitting at a desk for 9 hours a day, I would find that my wrist would hurt from being pushed into my desk from holding my mouse, and I began to wonder if a mouse ring would be a more ergonomic way to control devices like my laptop and phone. I decided to take my own approach to a smart ring design, but with a trackball for easier mouse control.
